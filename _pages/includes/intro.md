  I am currently a student research assistant at the ISLE lab working with [Prof. Ziang Xiao](https://www.ziangxiao.com/) and [Prof. Jie Gao](https://gaojie058.github.io/) and I have also actively engaged in NLP discussions with [Prof. Jason Eisner(Faculty advisor)](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/), [Prof. Anjalie Field](https://anjalief.github.io/index.html) at the[ Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP)](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/). At the same time, I received ***my Master's degree in Computer Science Engineering*** at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) in the 2024 Fall.

  Before joining JHU, I received  ***my B.S. degree in Information and Computer Science, and Mathematics*** from [Liaoning Technology University](https://en.lntu.edu.cn/).
  <!-- During my undergrad study, I spent time at the Institute of Mathematics and Systems Science and the Institute of Machine Learning and Data Mining, where I was advised by [Prof. Wei liu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wei-Liu-523) and [Prof.Yu Zhang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yu-Zhang-264) working in Multivariate Statistical Analysis, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Informatics Theory, Numerical Analysis, and Math Modeling and Optimization Algorithms field.-->
# 🤔 Research interest
My research interests include **Natural Language Processing** and **Human-center Qualitative Analysis Data Annotation/Curation in NLP**. Specifically,




have two important areas, 

- My first area is the intersection of **Natural Language Generation(NLG)**, **Large Language Models(LLMs), and interactions: conversation, interactive learning, multi-agents learning**,
- My next area is how to focus on the   

objective is in the area of the intersection of **Natural Language Generation(NLG)**, **Large Language Models(LLMs), and interactions: conversation, interactive learning, multi-agents learning**, and **Machine learning, Reinforcement Learning**.

具体来说,我的研究聚焦于的核心方向包括有两个:一个是自然语言处理(NLP)以及人机协作的定性数据分析。具体来说：第一. 自然语言处理(NLP)中的交互Text-based Virtual Environments,
第二是主观性数据标注,
