  I am currently a **graduate research assistant volunteer** at the Johns Hopkins University, working with [Prof. Kristina GligoriÄ‡](https://kristinagligoric.com/),[Prof. Ziang Xiao](https://www.ziangxiao.com/) and [Postdoc Fellow. Jie Gao](https://gaojie058.github.io/) and I have also actively engaged in NLP discussions with [Prof. Jason Eisner(Faculty advisor)](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/), [Prof. Anjalie Field(Course project advisor)](https://anjalief.github.io/index.html) at the[ Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP)](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/). At the same time, I received ***my Master's degree in Computer Science Engineering*** at [Johns Hopkins University (JHU)](https://www.jhu.edu/) in the 2024 Fall.

  Before joining JHU, I received  ***my B.S. degree in Information and Computer Science, and Mathematics*** from [Liaoning Technology University](https://en.lntu.edu.cn/).
  During my undergrad study, I spent time at the Institute of Mathematics and Systems Science and the Institute of Machine Learning and Data Mining, where I was advised by [Prof. Wei Liu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wei-Liu-523) and [Prof.Yu Zhang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yu-Zhang-264) works in Multivariate Statistical Analysis, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Informatics Theory, Numerical Analysis, and Math Modeling and Optimization Algorithms.

  I am also a **Co-founder** of ***SpringTeng AI***, a startup and community based in the China National University Science Park. This community focuses on developing AI data analysis systems, Software Patents Apps for industry technologies, and collaborating such as EACON Driverless, and the Chinese Ming Group.
  
# ðŸ¤” Research interest
My work topic is very closely related to **Data Science(Annotation/Collection/Statistical Inference) for LLMs Training and Evaluation**, which belongs to the intersection of **Large Language Models(LLMs)**, **Advanced Statistical Inference/Machine learning**, and **Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCI-AI)**. \
Specifically, my pre-research project and work are motivated by some fundamental questions, including:
- <span style="color:red; font-weight: #FF0000;"> **1. Human-AI Alignment for Social NLP Subjective data**:</span> How to achieve the bidirectional Human-AI Alignment to bridge the socio-technical gap in building LLMs for an effective data annotation/collection pipeline and LLMs for mining/analysis more enriched information in NLP subjective data tasks.
- <span style="color:red; font-weight: #FF0000;"> **2. LLMs for evaluation and code evaluation**:</span> How to evaluate and improve the capabilities of LLMs and agents to understand and interact with humans in the interaction process, like simulating the text-based world.
- <span style="color:red; font-weight: #FF0000;"> **3. Machine learning and Statistical Inference**:</span> How to understand data statistics dynamics using math modeling and developing efficient machine learning algorithms for large-scale data analysis and intelligent pattern recognition.
