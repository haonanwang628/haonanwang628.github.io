I am currently a research assistant at the ISLE lab working with [Prof. Ziang Xiao](https://www.ziangxiao.com/) and [Prof. Jie Gao](https://gaojie058.github.io/) in 2025 Spring and a graduate Master's degree in Computer student at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) in 2024 Fall.

Prior to JHU, I received my B.S. degree in Information and Computer Science, and Mathematics from the [Liaoning Technology University](https://en.lntu.edu.cn/). During my undergrad study, I spent time at the Institute of Mathematics and Systems Science and the Institute of Machine Learning and Data Mining, where I was advised by [Prof. Wei liu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wei-Liu-523) and [Prof.Yu Zhang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yu-Zhang-264) working in Multivariate Statistical Analysis, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Informatics Theory, Numerical Analysis, and Math Modeling and Optimization Algorithms field.
# ðŸ¤” Research interest
My research objective is in the area of the intersection of **Natural Language Understanding(NLG)**, and **Machine learning**. \
Specifically, use a mix of qualitative analysis and qualitative analysis methods and explore how we can understand, leverage, and evaluate the social-technical gap between generative AI technologies and human-centered interactive perspectives, like **Large Language Models(LLMs)**, **Large Language Models(LLMs) for Agent**, and **Large Vision Models(LVMs) and so on**. And build human-centered design interactive systems to help humans better use systems based on these explorations to enhance human decision-making collaboratively and to support the mutual development of the Human-centered and AI community.
