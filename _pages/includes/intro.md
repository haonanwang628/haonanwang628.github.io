  I am currently a graduate research assistant volunteer at the Johns Hopkins University working with [Prof. Kristina GligoriÄ‡](https://kristinagligoric.com/),[Prof. Ziang Xiao](https://www.ziangxiao.com/) and [Postdoc Fellow. Jie Gao](https://gaojie058.github.io/) and I have also actively engaged in NLP discussions with [Prof. Jason Eisner(Faculty advisor)](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/), [Prof. Anjalie Field(Course project advisor)](https://anjalief.github.io/index.html) at the[ Center for Language and Speech Processing (CLSP)](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/). At the same time, I received ***my Master's degree in Computer Science Engineering*** at [Johns Hopkins University (JHU)](https://www.jhu.edu/) in the 2024 Fall.

  Before joining JHU, I received  ***my B.S. degree in Information and Computer Science, and Mathematics*** from [Liaoning Technology University](https://en.lntu.edu.cn/).
  During my undergrad study, I spent time at the Institute of Mathematics and Systems Science and the Institute of Machine Learning and Data Mining, where I was advised by [Prof. Wei Liu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wei-Liu-523) and [Prof.Yu Zhang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yu-Zhang-264) works in Multivariate Statistical Analysis, Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Informatics Theory, Numerical Analysis, and Math Modeling and Optimization Algorithms.
  
# ðŸ¤” Research interest
My research interests include **Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCI-AI)**, **Natural Language Processing(NLP)**, **Statistical Inference**, and **Machine learning**. My research work is motivated by the fundamental question of **How to achieve and support bidirectional Human-AI Alignment between understanding humans at scale and AI data/algorithms/systems to bridge the socio-technical gap**.

Specifically, I am currently interested in and my pre-research work includes:
- <span style="color:red; font-weight: #FF0000;"> **1. Human-AI Alignment Interaction/Collaboration**:</span> How to build a Human-AI Data Annotation/Optimization/Selection Framework for Subjective and Ambiguous Labeling text in multiple fields to improve quality datasets.
- <span style="color:red; font-weight: #FF0000;"> **2. LLMs for evaluation and application**:</span> How to evaluate and improve the capabilities of LLMs and agents to understand and interact with humans in the interaction process.
- <span style="color:red; font-weight: #FF0000;"> **3. Machine learning and Statistical Inference**:</span> How to understand data statistics dynamics using math modeling and developing efficient machine learning algorithms for large-scale data analysis and intelligent pattern recognition.
